### Routing-Key pattern

You can access values from each record an store them into the routing-key, by specifying a record-accessor.

#### Example Record-Accessor
``` conf
$['key1'][0]["key2"]
```

The routing-key parts are delimited by the `RoutingKeyDelimiter`. If a string in one of the record-accesors containes the delimiter the plugin will not work as expected.


#### Example Routing-key

``` conf
$["loglevel_3"].$["loglevel_1"][2]["sublevel"][0].$["loglevel_2"]["info_loglevel"]
```

This functionality has been implemented with the [Record Accessor - Plugin Helper](https://docs.fluentd.org/plugin-helper-overview/api-plugin-helper-record_accessor)



## Run
If you want to run the plugin with the example config in `/conf`, you need to run the following command:
```bash
fluent-bit -e ./out_rabbitmq.so -c conf/fluent-bit-docker.conf
```
